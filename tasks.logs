 In file E10-JG_us--2022-12-01.0001.fcs the percentage of cells in the first singlet gate is outside of a range from 85 to 98 %. 


 In file E12-JG_aIgE--2022-12-01.0001.fcs the percentage of cells in the debris gate is outside of a range from 25 to 65 %. 


 The number of events in file E12-JG_aIgE--2022-12-01.0001.fcs is below 150.000. This is very likely to result in problems for the analysis and the results must be handled with care.

 In file E8-JG_fMLP--2022-11-28.0001.fcs the percentage of cells in the first singlet gate is outside of a range from 85 to 98 %. 


 In file F1-JG_spelt-100ug--2022-11-28.0001.fcs the percentage of cells in the debris gate is outside of a range from 25 to 65 %. 


 The number of events in file F1-JG_spelt-100ug--2022-11-28.0001.fcs is below 150.000. This is very likely to result in problems for the analysis and the results must be handled with care.

 In file B9-JG_fMLP--2022-04-21.0001.fcs the percentage of cells in the first singlet gate is outside of a range from 85 to 98 %. 


 The number of events in file B9-JG_fMLP--2022-04-21.0001.fcs is below 150.000. This is very likely to result in problems for the analysis and the results must be handled with care. 


 Threshold Checks: Threshold checks haven't been passed with initial settings. Iterative search for a better coarse SSC-A threshold boundary is being performed.

Attention: No valid solution was found by changing the initial SSC-A coarse boundary.

`distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in seaborn v0.14.0.

Please adapt your code to use either `displot` (a figure-level function with
similar flexibility) or `histplot` (an axes-level function for histograms).

`distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in seaborn v0.14.0.

Please adapt your code to use either `displot` (a figure-level function with

`distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in seaborn v0.14.0.

Please adapt your code to use either `displot` (a figure-level function with
